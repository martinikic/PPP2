from github import Github

# First, create a Github instance using your Github username and access token
g = Github("<your-github-access-token>")

# Replace "<your-github-access-token>" with your actual GitHub access token
# You can create a token by following these instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

# Next, get the repository that you want to add the commit to
repo = g.get_repo("<your-username>/<your-repo-name>")

# Replace "<your-username>/<your-repo-name>" with the actual username and repository name

# Now, get the file that you want to update
file_path = "path/to/file.txt"
file_contents = repo.get_contents(file_path)

# Replace "path/to/file.txt" with the actual path to the file you want to update

# Now, update the file contents and create a new commit
new_file_contents = file_contents.decoded_content.decode() + "\nThis is a new line added to the file!"
commit_message = "Add new line to file"

# Update the file in the repository
repo.update_file(file_path, commit_message, new_file_contents, file_contents.sha)

# Print a success message
print(f"Added new commit to file '{file_path}' in repository '{repo.full_name}'")
